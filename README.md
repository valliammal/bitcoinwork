The task is to implement "AuxPow" into repository bellow in a way that  to implement auxpow into other coins as well that said please write the code to be somehow universal and easily transferable for different coin.

All auxpow related code into new folder and than link from the "core files in /src" to this new folder.

Here is the repo where is auxpow needed to be implemented

Bitstar = Scrypt algorithm
https://github.com/bitstar/bitstar

I have included some of the coins that has AuxPow already build in as are for instance:

Dogecoin = Scrypto algorithm (this is what we need)
https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin

Canadaecoin = Scrypto algorithm (this is what we need)
https://github.com/ThisIsOurCoin/canadaecoin/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=auxpow

Namecoin = Sha256 as bitcoin not really sure if implementing of auxpow differ for sha256 and scrypt but thought it is worth to mention this coin 
https://github.com/namecoin/namecoin-core

Huntercoin (This coins has two algorithms = Sha256 as bitcoin and Scrypt as a litcoin so not sure if this is best sample since it may include more code than we need)
https://github.com/chronokings/huntercoin/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=auxpow 

orgcoin (Coin doesn't work anymore,but you can see how auxow has been implemented)
https://github.com/ifaist0s/orgcoin/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=auxpow

Auxpow is the Auxillary proof of work. This is portion of work implemented for the coins.
To actually the build is the QT.
